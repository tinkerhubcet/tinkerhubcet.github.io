Introduction to DevOps was conducted aiming students who were new to tech and projects. Our guest sharath brilliantly presented a great session on DevOps that helped a lot to understand the possibilities and skills one can develop around this in becoming professional at handling projects using various components like Docker, Jenkins etc. Students really liked the Sense of Humor in the slides which kept them active throughout the session and at last Sharath shared a lot of resources for beginners for their journey ahead in DevOps.
