One of the best sessions on Data Science and Machine Learning. Damanpreet made sure we get to ask more questions than listen to her presentation. With that lot of students cleared their doubts about ML and Data Science and we got to hear her inspirational journey to Microsoft, how she started. She shared some valuable resources and websites with us to kickstart our Journey in Data Science and ML. It was a really good interactive session and we are thankful to her for this.
